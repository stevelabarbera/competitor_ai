# RAG System Development Status

## 🎯 Project Overview
Cybersecurity competitive intelligence RAG system with local data sources.

## 📁 Architecture
- **Data**: `internal_documents/` (PDFs) + `output/` (web crawler results)
- **Search**: ChromaDB (semantic) + Whoosh (keyword) + Hybrid + Full context
- **Stack**: Ollama LLM, Gradio UI, custom chunker

## 🚨 Current Issue: Data Quality Crisis

### Problem
```
❌ Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'
```
**Root Cause**: ChromaDB chunks have `None` metadata instead of proper metadata objects.

### Impact
- Debug tools crash
- Semantic search returns low-quality results  
- Model doesn't prioritize local data
- At one point, it was identified that chunker.py was returning lists and they were being added to the chroma_db.I'm not sure if lists are not allowed or the algorithm we're trying to achieve should consist of only strings.

## 🛠️ Immediate Fixes (READY TO IMPLEMENT)

### 1. Debug Script Safety
```python
sources = [meta.get('source', 'Unknown') if meta is not None else 'No Metadata' for meta in metadatas]
```

### 2. Ingestion Validation in `ingest_internal_doc.py`
```python
def process_document(text, filename):
    chunks = chunk_text_smart(text, chunk_size=512, overlap=64)  # Returns list
    
    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
        if len(chunk.strip()) < 50:  # Skip short chunks
            continue
            
        metadata = {
            'source': filename,
            'chunk_index': i,
            'total_chunks': len(chunks),
            'word_count': len(chunk.split())
        }
        
        if not validate_chunk_and_metadata(chunk, metadata):
            continue
            
        # Add to ChromaDB (your existing method)

def validate_chunk_and_metadata(chunk, metadata):
    return metadata is not None and len(chunk.strip()) >= 10 and 'source' in metadata
```

### 3. Clean Re-ingestion
- Delete corrupted ChromaDB
- Re-ingest with validation
- Run health check

## 📈 Noise Sources
1. **Low-relevance chunks** - Vector search returns legally similar but irrelevant content
2. **No metadata filtering** - Not isolating high-quality chunks at query time
3. **Mixed data quality** - Corporate boilerplate polluting vector space

## 🎯 Next Steps Priority

### Phase 1: Data Quality (CURRENT)
1. ✅ Fix metadata validation 
2. 🔄 Clean re-ingestion with validation
3. 🔄 Add collection health checks

### Phase 2: Search Quality  
1. **Metadata filtering** - Filter semantic search by source
2. **Source prioritization** - Prefer `internal_documents` over `output`
3. **Chunk quality validation** - Minimum 50-100 words

## 🚀 Success Metrics
- [ ] Debug tools run without crashes
- [ ] Semantic search returns relevant local data with [source] citations
- [ ] Less than 5% irrelevant results in top 5 semantic matches

## ⚠️ Key Gotchas
- **ChromaDB batch operations** can fail silently
- **Chunker returns lists** - must iterate in ingestion pipeline
- **Metadata consistency** critical across ingestion runs

## I was interested in trying to manually verify a query and response are coming back as they should be. chroma_inspect_database.py was just created. need to understand what the score consist of. For example, 31515.182 & 33333.648 is the one closest to zero a closer match?
