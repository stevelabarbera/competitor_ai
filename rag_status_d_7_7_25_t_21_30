# RAG System Status - Competitive Intelligence 7-7-25|200:42

## 🎯 Current State
- **Working**: ChromaDB ingestion with enhanced metadata
- **Problem**: Documents merged together, losing company context
- **Goal**: Clean company-specific search results

## 📁 Architecture
```
├── internal_data/           # High-priority docs
├── output/                 # Web crawler results  
├── search_engine.py        # Semantic + keyword search
├── ingest_internal_doc.py  # Document ingestion
├── chroma_db/             # Vector storage
└── whoosh_index/          # Keyword index
```

## 🚨 Current Issue: Context Loss
**Problem**: All documents mixed together, can't isolate by company
**Impact**: Search returns generic results instead of company-specific intel

## 💡 Proposed Solution: Company Tagging System

### In Content Files:
```
Company_Names: Tenable,Tenable.com,Tenable_com,Tenablelabs
Company_Names: Disney,ESPN,Pixar,Lucasfilm,Marvel
Company_Names: CrowdStrike,Crowdstrike.com,Falcon_Platform
```

### Benefits:
- ✅ **Accurate mapping** - No domain parsing guesswork
- ✅ **Multiple aliases** - Disney=ESPN=Pixar handled properly  
- ✅ **Manual control** - We define the relationships
- ✅ **Search filtering** - Query by specific competitor

### Implementation Plan:
1. **Parse company tags** from content files during ingestion
2. **Add company metadata** to chunks (e.g., `{"primary_company": "Disney", "aliases": ["ESPN", "Pixar"]}`)
3. **Filter searches** by company parameter
4. **Maintain company mapping** in separate config file

## 🔧 Quick Tests Available
- **Inspector script**: `python db_inspector.py` - See current data
- **Search test**: Test semantic queries
- **Metadata check**: Verify chunk quality

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. **Design company tag parser** - Extract Company_Names from content
	- add metadata like {"primary_company": "Tenable", "all_aliases": ["Tenable", "Tenable.com", "Tenable_com", "Tenablelabs"]} during digestion of parsing 'output'&'internal_data'
	- Enable filtered search - search("pricing", company="Tenable") returns only Tenable content


2. **Update ingestion** - Add company metadata to chunks  
3. **Add search filters** - Enable company-specific queries
4. **Test isolation** - Verify clean company separation

## 📊 Success Metrics
- [ ] Search "Tenable pricing" returns only Tenable docs
- [ ] Company aliases properly mapped (Disney query finds ESPN content)
- [ ] No cross-contamination between competitors
- [ ] Fast, relevant, company-specific results

## Be aware of gotchas!
1. content text for each company is currently being merged all into one document losing context
2. I noticed logic somewhere where we were skipping content that was less than 100 characters long which is concerning.Whois to say that a hundred characters of data isn't pretty important?
3. as we build functionality we try to make sure that we're not losing something already there.Should be greater then or at least equal to unless clearly documented.
